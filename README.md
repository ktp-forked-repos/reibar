Reibar
======

Reibar is a Prolog DCG and Ruby wrapper for generating X-bar theory syntax
trees and ontologically promiscuous semantic representations.  It was begun as
a project for Harvard's computational linguistics course, CS 187, taught by
Stuart Shieber in 2013.  The initial import is of a basic grammar implemented
as a homework assignment, based on the PNLA text.  Little of the course code
remains, save for the lambda notation, the utils.pl file, and the design
inspiration.

This is a just-for-fun project, but to drive it forward, it comes with a few
real goals:

- Support all of the syntax taught in an intro syntax course, say, Harvard's
  Ling 102.
- Support all the syntax covered in [this textbook][1].
- Allow basic sentence queries, e.g., "What did Max do?" for "Max went to the
  store with his friend."
