\maketitle

For the most part, I'd be interested in extending the collection of small
systems we built in Prolog in the second half of the course, in the following
ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend the syntax engine to handle pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and
    complementizers, and other things perhaps. This doesn't have direct
    relevance to the rest of my proposed project, but I think the trees are
    pretty.
  \item Extend the semantics engine accordingly (perhaps merging it with the
    tree generator and figuring out how best to refactor Prolog).
  \item Make a basic user interface for specifying paradigms for new nouns and
    verbs (i.e., sentences are parsed by the toplevel script, and anything not
    in the dynamic lexicon files is added by asking the user for properties of
    the word).
  \item Create a question-answering system about user-submitted sentences,
    e.g., if the sentence is "Frog's friends baked Toad a red cake.", answer
    such questions as, "Whose friends?" or "What did Frog's friends bake?" or
    "What was the cake like?"
\end{itemize}

The last item in particular is pretty open-ended, and seems like it would be
the primary "product" of the project. I'd like some thoughts on what would be
some good minimum specifications to achieve, but I like the exploratory
direction this heads in.
